## Submission Summary

Thank you for this opportunity.

This wasn't just a landing page build. It was a mission.

As someone who's been deeply aligned with Vultisig from the start — not just as a supporter, but as a long-time believer and hobbyist contributor since first hearing [@jpthor](https://x.com/jpthor) on the [WOAS podcast (June 25, 2024)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/btc-down-alts-outperform-crypto-town-hall-w-thorchain/id1500066831?i=1000660227158) — I approached this challenge as something more than a contest. It felt like a quiet job interview. One I prepared for with care, precision, and respect for the vision you're building.

### Where I Started

Already familiar with Vultisig’s goals and ethos, I didn’t have to "study" the brand — I’ve lived with it, used it, and followed its evolution closely. I’ve submitted bug reports, usage feedback, and suggestions across GitHub and Discord. But I did take this opportunity to dig even deeper.

I reviewed every public surface — your site, docs, social tone, branding kit — with one goal in mind: elevate the experience without losing the soul. I wasn’t trying to reinvent Vultisig. I wanted to re-present it at the highest level, with the UX clarity and polish of institutions like Cash App, River, Stripe, and Tesla.

From typography to layout flow, every decision passed through a single lens:

> "Does this respect and reflect Vultisig’s sovereign, seedless, non-custodial foundation?"

### Refining the Message

I focused on communicating cryptographic depth without technical fog. MPC and TSS aren’t simple concepts — but they represent decades of security research, and Vultisig makes them usable by everyone. That story matters.

So I worked the copy line by line to reflect that power in plain language — confident, institutional, accessible.

I distilled it down to the core message:

> **Seedless by design. Sovereign by default. Open and simple self-custody — for everyone, everywhere, on any device.**

Every headline. Every subheader. Every call to action.
Nothing was filler. Everything was intentional.

### Design Ethos

The existing [vultisig.com](https://vultisig.com) and sub-sites already look fantastic — credit where it’s due. The brand, mascot, color scheme, and layout all reflect world-class design instincts. That’s what made the [vibe coding challenge](https://x.com/vultisig/status/1905309260231196795) so surprising. It already felt "done." — they don't need a new website.

With a focus on simplicity, I aimed to create a clean and streamlined design. By minimizing unnecessary elements and using animations sparingly, I prioritized the mobile user experience. The goal was to ensure the site feels like a secure and trustworthy platform, free from distractions or gimmicks.

Even the bot mascot (R2V2 I've named it) — clever and well-designed — is gently reserved for the airdrop section. A nod to the degen crowd, but never at the expense of institutional trust.

> **No hype. No overload. Just clarity, elegance, and purpose.**

I also made a key usability choice:
While reviewing the current site, I noticed a global CSS rule:

```css
* {
  user-select: none;
}
```

This disables all text selection across the page — including addresses, commands, and other key elements. I chose not to carry it forward.

Restricting user selection can:

- Reduce accessibility (screen readers, keyboard use)
- Frustrate users who want to copy information
- Undermine browser-native behavior

So instead, I prioritized openness, accessibility, and trust — especially for a product built on sovereignty.

I'd also be happy to contribute further on any accessibility work for the Vultisig app itself. Accessibility is a personal passion of mine, and I believe it's critical for global adoption.

### Mobile-First Focus

The world is mobile. And so was my build.

While the bulk of the submissions are likely to be desktop-first concepts, I flipped it: I built the mobile version first and polished later for larger viewports. Mobile was the primary lens through which I tested every decision — spacing, CTA flow, scroll timing, and copy density.

The desktop experience is now fully polished and pushed live. All **eight sections** are now complete and responsive across devices. (Initial submission launched with four sections live, per timeline constraints.)

### Technical Build

This was never a Figma mockup. It was production-level code from the start.

- Built in **React + Tailwind**, with clean JSX and modular components
- Used **Framer Motion** for intentional, low-friction animations
- Fully responsive, with scroll behaviors tested on real devices
- Typography, spacing, and color matched to the brand kit
- Accessible decisions made throughout (e.g., allowing text selection)
- Created by human, enhanced by AI.

As the contest closes, I’ve:

- Published the full source code
- Annotated the repo for clarity and learning
- Opened the project to community discussion and iteration

Because I believe in the open ethos Vultisig embodies.

### Why I Care

I’ve spent years analyzing wallets — especially hardware wallets. I’ve used them all. And I’ve been underwhelmed.

Even the market leaders, like Ledger, still ship with pieces of paper to store your seed phrase. In 2025. That’s not innovation — that’s an industry stuck in the past. Hardware wallets feel like a trap: expensive up front, dangerous to mismanage, and often reliant on centralized bridges or firmware you can’t audit.

Vultisig fixes all of that.

No $100 lock-in. No $100/month custody service.
Just real sovereignty, running open-source, on hardware I already own.

> **Vultisig doesn’t chase hype. It doesn’t bend to trends.**
> **It builds and ships with integrity. And that’s why this project means so much to me.**

---

### Final Thought

Vultisig didn’t just build something cool.
Vultisig built the missing piece.

So I didn’t treat this like a design gig.
I treated it like a legacy.
One I want to be part of.

Respectfully,
— Tony ("RowboTony")
