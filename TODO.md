# Todos, Issues, Optional Features

## Issues
- Optimize desktop experience above 2560px

## TODO
- Reduce the prominence of info-cards
- Add active link highlight (ScrollSpy) for nav
- Add framer-motion scroll-trigger fade-up
- Footer version: site pulse
- Check about-site typography on all viewport sizes

## Optional
- Add animations (fade-in, scroll-triggered pop).
- Tooltips like “Every swap signed. Twice. Twice.” in DeFi block.
- console.log easter egg

## Usability
- Improve Nav fonts on huge screens above 2560: the Nav goes full screen and looks cluttered, increase the font size or appreciably increase the entire header height
